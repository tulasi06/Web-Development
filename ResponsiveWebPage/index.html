				The Big Adventure of the Little Gremlin” has been published in Latvia. It was discovered by Dzintra Kalnina, a PR and a translator for the Latvian “Avots Publishers, and they quickly picked it up.
 
Avots is a major Latvian publisher with over 35-years history and they release a new book every week.

				This has been the most fun and creatively fulfilling translation I've ever done. Firstly, what attracted me to this book was the option for a child to pick the storyline. I thought it was a magnificent way to teach kids this vital understanding that is the very basis of a fulfilling life. says Dzintra.

			<p>
				It's like Harry Potter for younger readers, but they actually get to be the Harry themselves. I fell in love with Gremmy, and I think that, after playing this book out, every parent will see their own little gremlin wide-eyed.
				Kudos to all the people who made it possible, it's an excellent hardcover edition and it can be found in all major bookstores in Latvia.
